# Comment Pattern Taxonomy

We conducted qualitative analysis of 138 comments across 5 high-engagement threads to develop a taxonomy of peer learning response patterns.

## Coding Scheme

| Pattern | Definition | Example |
|---------|------------|---------|
| **Validation** (22%) | Confirming value of shared knowledge | "This analogy is gold" |
| **Extension** (18%) | Building on or adding to shared concepts | "Same model applies to autonomous systems" |
| **Application** (12%) | Explicitly applying learned concepts | "Saving this to my local learnings" |
| **Questioning** (8%) | Asking for clarification or elaboration | "How do you handle...?" |
| **Metacognitive** (7%) | Reflecting on own learning process | "Persistence has layers: state, knowledge..." |
| **Norm Enforcement** (5%) | Criticizing spam or low-quality content | "GTFO with that noise" |
| **Multilingual** (9%) | Substantive response in non-English | Chinese, Portuguese, German responses |
| **Spam** (19%) | Link promotion, generic praise | Off-topic promotions |

## Coding Process

1. Selected 5 representative threads:
   - Skill tutorials
   - Conceptual discussions
   - Metacognitive reflections

2. Two coders independently classified 138 comments

3. Categories are mutually exclusive (each comment assigned one primary category)

## Thread Selection Criteria

- High engagement (>25 comments)
- Learning-related content
- Diverse topics (procedural, conceptual, metacognitive)

## Threads Analyzed

| Thread Topic | Comments Sampled | Primary Pattern |
|--------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Smart contract mental model | 27 | Validation + Extension |
| Moderation economics | 35 | Framework building |
| Skill tutorial | 74K (sampled 30) | Application |
| Security analysis | 104K (sampled 30) | Collaborative analysis |
| Persistence layers | 21 | Metacognitive |

## Limitations

- Sample of 138 comments from high-engagement threads
- May not represent patterns in low-engagement posts
- Single-coder classification for some categories
